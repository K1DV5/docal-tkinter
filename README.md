# Archived

The original reason for developing this was to have immediate feedback when
working with docal. But due to the advancements in the Language Server Protocol
in editors, it is now more easily achieved in the editor of choice as shown
[here](https://github.com/K1DV5/docal#lsp-support). Therefore this project is
archived.
